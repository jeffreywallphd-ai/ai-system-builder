Effective projection records, snapshots, commands, references and provenance are
explicitly reconstructed with the shared bounded passive DTO schemas. Declared
labels/metadata, canonical timestamps, revision identities and finite graph-summary
counts/actual boolean flags are validated. Projected metadata retains safe nested
arrays, false/zero/null and existing field rules with bounded recursion; credential
representations, paths, accessors, cycles and unknown payload fields deny.
Diagnostic messages remain generic. Snapshot identity is required for snapshots.
The fixed local projection/snapshot collections validate on read, before writes,
and before/after mutation callbacks. Invalid stored records deny without rewriting
bytes or invoking a mutation callback. This does not grant source authority, add
transport admission, enable uncomposed runtime families or satisfy controlled
qualification. Rollback must preserve the stronger record denial.
